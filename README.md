This repository contains coursework from Fundamentals of Web Development, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Throughout the class, I practiced web design concepts through structured modules, gaining experience in building and styling web pages. The course concluded with an individual final project, where I created a fully designed website for a fictional laundromat, demonstrating my ability to structure content with HTML and apply CSS for layout and styling. This repository showcases my progress in fundamental web development skills.
